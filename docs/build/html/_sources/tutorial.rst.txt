Quesdadiya is a data annotation project management platform where you can manage a
project through `Command Line Interface (CLI) <https://github.com/SiameseLab>`__ and annotate data on
`Web GUI <https://github.com/SiameseLab>`__ to generate a triplet data set for developing Siamese models.

Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------
Quesadiya requires **sqlalchemy>=1.3.12**. Install the package by

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install sqlalchemy

After installing **sqlalchemy**, run

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install quesadiya

Check installation by

.. code-block:: bash

  $ quesadiya --help

Installation from Source
------------------------
1. Make sure your environment has **sqlalchemy>=1.3.12**.
1. `git clone` this repo
1. `cd quesadiya`
1. run `pip install .`
1. check installation by running `quesadiya` on your terminal

Project Management
==================

Quesadiya provides the command-line interface (CLI) to manage data annotation projects.

Create Project
--------------
You can create a data annotation project by

.. code-block:: bash

  $ quesadiya create <project_name> <admin_name> <datapath> [OPTIONS]

For example,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ quesadiya create queso me data/sample_triplets.jsonl
  $ Loading input data: 5 row [00:00, 1495.40 row/s]
  $ Admin password:
  $ Repeat for confirmation:
  $ Inserting data. This may take a while...
  $ Finish creating a new project 'queso'

**Caution**:
*<datapath>* must be a jsonline file, where each row must follow the format below:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "anchor_sample_id": "string (max 100 char)",
    "anchor_sample_text": "list of text",
    "anchor_sample_title": "text (nullable)",
    "candidate_group_id": "string (max 100 char)",
    "candidates": [
      "item": {
        "candidate_sample_id": "string (max 100 char)",
        "candidate_sample_text": "list of text",
        "candidate_sample_title": "text (nullable)"
      }
    ]
  }

*anchor* is the sample you want to compare to the positive sample and the negative sample.
*candidates* is a list of candidates for a positive and a negative sample. The sample collaborator
selects is recorded as a positive sample and **quesadiya** chooses a negative sample from the rest.

**Tips**: You can add collaborators from a jsonline file when you create a project by

.. code-block:: bash

  $ quesadiya create queso me data/triplets.jsonl -a data/collaborators.jsonl

Note that `<collaborator_path>` must be a jsonline file, where each row must follow the format below:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    'name': "string (max 150 char)",
    'password': "string (max 128 char)",
    'contact': "string (max 254 char)"
  }

See `Command Line Interface Guide <>` for more details.

Run Project
-----------

You can annotate a data set by running quesadiya:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ quesadiya run [OPTION]

You can specify the port number to run the quesadiya server by option. For example,
.. code-block:: bash

  $ quesadiya run -p 4000

Quesadiya's default port number is 1133.

Once you run a project, open your browser and access http://localhost:1133/.

Then, select a project and type admin name and password.

This leads you to the admin page. In the admin page, you can do the followings:
  * view discarded samples
  * view progress of each collaborator
  * edit collaborators

**Tips**: Admin user cannot annotate data. If you're the admin and like to annotate
samples, make a collaborator account for yourself and login with the account.

See `Admin Guide <>` for more details.

Data Annotation
---------------

Data annotation is very simple and intuitive in Quesadiya. **Anchor text** is shown
on the left hand side of the screen and **Candidates** are on the right. Collaborators
can either **select** positive sample among candidates or **discard** a sample if the sample is corrupted for some reason.
Admin can view discarded samples and push a sample back to the project in the admin page.
